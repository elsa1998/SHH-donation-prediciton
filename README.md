# SHH-donation-prediciton

## Goal
Helping our client - SHH (Second Harvest Heartland)- US leading hunger relief agencies to identify the relationship between social media exposure and donation amounts.

## How to do?
We built predictive models using data from 2020 to 2022 to find key factors affecting donation outcomes based on media channels and exposure.
Also, we conducted text analysis for data aggregation on rolling base, and used modeling techniques (Linear Regression, KNN, RegressionTree) to identify impact of earned media and donor activities considering social echo, seasonality, etc.
Finally, collaborated with stakeholders and presented recommendations to streamline donor behavior evaluation metrics for strategy making.
